Here’s the list of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) from past information sessions. 

**Eligibility, Criteria & Application**

* **Why should I apply for the PSC Scholarship before my final examinations? What if I change my mind?**\
  By starting on your application form early, you will have more time to prepare and submit your essay and supporting documents. The sooner you submit your application, the sooner you can focus whole-heartedly on your final examinations and concurrently be shortlisted for further assessment, if you are found suitable. This will also give you an opportunity to seek clarity on your scholarship application at an early stage. 


* **What are the shortlisting criteria and selection process like?**\
  We consider academic results, co-curricular activity (CCA) records, psychometric test results, school reports and National Service (NS) reports (if applicable). All shortlisted candidates for PSC Scholarships go through an interview with a psychologist and a panel interview with the PSC.


* **Will PSC consider my preliminary examination results?**\
  No, preliminary examination results are not considered as the standards vary across schools.


* **What if I did not do well for my A-Level/IB/NUS High School/Polytechnic Diploma examination?**\
  PSC considers many factors in offering a scholarship. These include your integrity, commitment to serve the community and leadership skills. Academic results are only one measure of your ability. You will still stand a chance to receive a scholarship offer, if you have strong compensating factors in other areas.


* **How will the Game-Based Assessment (GBA) be used in the selection process?**\
  In the 2022 PSC Scholarships Selection exercise, the GBA will be included in the existing range of assessment tools that the PSC uses to identify potential scholarship recipients holistically. These tools include co-curricular activity (CCA) records, psychometric tests, school assessment reports, National Service reports (if applicable), community service projects, leadership roles, other achievements, internship records and a panel interview.


* **Should I apply for the scholarship now or only after I have completed my National Service?**\
  You can submit your application any time before the closing date. If you are required to attend a PSC panel interview during National Service, it will be facilitated.
  
  
* **Eligibility for the PSC scholarships**\
  You must be a Singapore Citizen, have strong leadership qualities/potential and good academic and co-curricular activities (CCA) records. 


* **Are there any changes to the process due to COVID-19?**\
  The PSC Secretariat is monitoring the situation closely and will practise safe distancing and preventive measures in line with advisories from the multi-ministry taskforce. We are also prepared to move assessments online, as we have done so for the past scholarship cycle in adherence to circuit breaker measures.
  
  
* **May I apply for a SAF or SPF Scholarship even though I have not enlisted for National Service?**\
  Yes, if you apply for a SAF or SPF Scholarship before being enlisted for National Service, PSC can still make a provisional scholarship offer, based on the information in your application package. You will need to qualify for Officer Cadet School (OCS) to be considered for the SAF/SPF Scholarship. PSC will look into confirming your provisional scholarship offer later on, when your military reports are available.


**Countries, Universities & Courses**

* **What courses can I pursue under a PSC scholarship?**\
  PSC scholarships holders may pursue a wide range of courses. These include engineering, science and mathematics, accountancy, law, economics, philosophy, history, etc.


* **Do I need to have a confirmed university offer before applying for a PSC scholarship? Does PSC have a list of recognised universities?**\
  You do not need to have a confirmed university offer at the time of application for PSC scholarships. PSC scholarships are awarded based on merit. All applicants, with or without a university offer, will be awarded a scholarship if they are found suitable.


* **What are the courses of study that I can take under the PSC Undergraduate Scholarship (Mid-Term)/PSC Master’s Scholarship?**\
  The course of study should be in an area relevant to the work of the Civil Service. Some courses of study are very narrow in focus and of very limited relevance to the Public Service. In such cases, we might not support that course of study. The PSC Master's Scholarship is not tenable for MBA programmes.


* **What is the duration of study under the PSC Master’s Scholarship?**\
  The PSC Master’s Scholarship is open to undergraduates or recent graduates with no more than 3 years of working experience in the private/ non-government sector. PSC Master's Scholarship holders are given up to 2 years to pursue full-time Master's programmes either locally or overseas. 


**Career Paths**

* **What are the differences between PSC Scholarships and Ministry scholarships? How do the career paths differ between the two?**\
  The key differences between the PSC Scholarships and other Ministry scholarships lie in the talent development programme and career pathway.<br>\
  Most PSC Scholarship holders* are auto-emplaced on the Public Service Leadership Programme (PSLP) General Phases and will take on different job roles across 2-3 sectors within the first 8 years of their career. In contrast, Ministry scholarship holders tend to start work in the specific ministry, embark on their agency’s talent development programme, and future deployments also tend to be within that sector.<br>\
  Prospective applicants can look up the different type of scholarships on the PSC website or the respective agency’s website and compare the career pathway, the work they do and other factors (such as course of study, country of study etc) to make an informed decision based on their career aspirations.<br>\
  As it is essentially a career in the Public Service they are applying for, the scholarship being one of the avenues into Public Service, applicants should do their research on the career, sector and organization they hope to work in before applying for the relevant scholarships.<br>
  
  *except for scholarship holders on the Legal Service, Medicine/Dentistry and Uniformed careers


**National Service**

* **Should I apply for the scholarship now or only after I have completed my National Service?**\
  Those with NS obligations are highly encouraged to start early and submit their scholarship applications before enlisting in NS as they may not have the time to complete the submission of the application form, essay, supporting documents and video presentation afterwards.<br>\
  Additionally, enlisted applicants may find it difficult to attend the psychometric test, psychological interview and PSC interview when their schedule and trainings conflict with the sessions available. There are limited sessions each cycle, and there may not always be available slots on Saturdays.<br>\
  If applicants are unable to register for the assessment sessions within the given the timeframe, we will not be able to shortlist them further during the current scholarship cycle.
